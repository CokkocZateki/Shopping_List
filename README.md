# Shopping_List
AngularJS shopping list app - based off of http://lekkerlogic.com/2015/05/angularjs-and-bootstrap-mysql-shopping-list-tutorial/. Using this as a guide towards getting my feet wet with Angular.

## TODO
* Be able to update the price by clicking / tapping, and indicate whether unit price or all together
* Function to calculate sum of prices for what has been entered in the shopping list
* Instead of tapping on the item in the shopping list to update status to complete, require that a price is entered in order to complete the item from the shopping list and move to the bottom of the list
* Indexing / relational system to help cache items previously entered, and store historical data about the item with the timestamps and prices
* Ability to create multiple shopping lists
