AngularJS shopping list app - based off of http://lekkerlogic.com/2015/05/angularjs-and-bootstrap-mysql-shopping-list-tutorial/. Using this as a guide towards getting my feet wet with Angular. Using PHP ajax for the backend, with MySQL for db. Currently using Bootstrap for UI (which means also including jquery...) but I plan on getting away from this when ready. For user authorization I decided to try [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). For now I'm using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) to work locally on the project.

## To Do List / Ideas
- [X] ~~User authentication~~
- [ ] Unit / build testing
- [ ] Indexing / relational system to help cache items previously entered, and store historical data about the item with the timestamps and prices
- [X] ~~Ability to create multiple shopping lists~~
- [ ] Add photos to item purchased (ability to use camera on mobile device, no clue how hard this would be)
- [X] ~~Be able to update the price by clicking / tapping, and indicate whether unit price or all together~~
- [X] ~~Function to calculate sum of prices for what has been entered in the shopping list~~
- [X] ~~Instead of tapping on the item in the shopping list to update status to complete, require that a price is entered in order to complete the item from the shopping list and move to the bottom of the list~~
- [X] ~~Add notes to items purchased~~
